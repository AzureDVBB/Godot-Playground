# Godot-Playground
A place for all my prototypes made with the Godot game engine.

---

I love Godot for it's free and open-source nature, Python-like GDScript syntax.
I wanted to learn how it functions and make cool doodads with it.
(Since it's GUI is a lot nicer then Python UI libraries, less work to make pretty too!)

And the best way to learn is to learn by doing!

This also gives me an excuse to learn a bit of game design, as I'm getting quite sick of playing them.
So why not start making them?
